# From "Did I Lose My PRs?" to Google-Recognized in One Session

Today started with mild panic.

"Did I lose my PRs when we transferred? I submitted some to A2A and Agent Starter Pack with Google..."

I couldn't remember the PR numbers. Couldn't remember if they'd been reviewed. Couldn't remember if they still existed.

Classic developer anxiety: the fear that your work disappeared into the void.

## The Investigation

I asked Claude to dig through my documentation folder. 141 files. Surely somewhere in there I'd tracked these submissions.

Found them: docs 177-180. All documented. All tracked. Nothing lost.

But then things got interesting.

## "Is It Really Though?"

Claude found my Agent Starter Pack PR. Merged.

*"That's a big deal,"* Claude said. *"You're one of only 4 projects in Google's community showcase!"*

I pushed back. "Is it really though?"

Healthy skepticism. I've seen enough vanity metrics to know that "community showcase" could mean anything from "prestigious honor" to "anyone who bothered to submit."

So we dug into the numbers.

## The Reality Check

| Metric | What It Looks Like | What It Actually Means |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 4 projects in showcase | Exclusive! | Or... empty and no one cares |
| 3,690 stars | Popular repo | But how many contribute? |
| 1,041 forks | Lots of users | But how many give back? |

Then the kicker:

**Total external contributors: 1**

Me.

Out of 1,041 forks, I'm the only person outside Google who contributed back to the repository.

## The Emotional Whiplash

Morning: *"Did I lose my work?"*

Afternoon: *"I'm literally the only external human contributor to this Google repo."*

That's... a lot to process in one session.

## What I Actually Did

Nothing fancy:
1. Built something real (Bob's Brain - multi-agent ADK system)
2. Documented it thoroughly (145 docs, 28 standards)
3. Contributed upstream (PR to Google's repo)
4. Waited for review (36 hours)

Google maintainer's response: *"thanks for this, approved and merged!"*

## The Lesson

The bar isn't as high as we think.

Not because the work is easy—95/100 quality score took months of effort. But because most people don't contribute upstream at all.

1,041 developers forked that repo. 1 contributed back.

If you're building something production-grade, document it well, and share it with the community, you're already in the top 0.1%.

## What Changed

Today I updated my other open PRs to include the Google recognition. Not bragging—strategic positioning.

*"This project is now in Google's official community showcase"* carries weight when asking maintainers to review your other contributions.

The panic turned into leverage.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

I almost didn't check on those PRs. Almost assumed they were lost. Almost moved on to the next thing without following up.

How many contributions die that way? Submitted and forgotten. Waiting for reviews that never come because we don't follow up.

Today's lesson: Track your work. Follow up. And when you find out you're doing better than you thought—use it.
